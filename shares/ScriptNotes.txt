Greetings FSGALAM users and
welcome to 
this help module on ABs.

So what are ABs?  Well, 
FSGALAM places ABs on 
grid, pivot and form
components that can be
edited. 

For ex, the [News], [Find], 
and [List] components can 
be edited and therefore 
have ABs.  However the
ChgLogs and T&Qs pivtos
cannot be edited, and thus have 
no ABs.

[News] So the 1st thing 
we note about ABs is that
there are always 4 ABs
when they appear:
[select all]
	I/C (blue plus),
	D/R (R X), 
	U/C (B arrow)
	P/L (G tri).

Now each AB has an 
associated Role-and-Impact
customized by the 
Moderator for each grid.

In our News grid eg we 
see that the Mod has
allocated the ABs to ...
The Mod is free to realloc
at any time the R&Is to 
faciliate change reviews.

So in summary: whereas 
the ABs always
perform the same change 
action, 
the Role-and-Impact of
your change may itself
change from one day to 
the next, as the Mod
reallocates these R&Is. 
Again, the Mod reallocs
the R&Is to 
faciliate change review.

We also need to know that
ABs work in concert
with Record [Selectors].

I'll illustrate this
interaction with the 
News grid...

So if I dont select 
any rec, the Insert AB
will Insert a new rec 
[type some stuff].

However, if I select a rec 
1st, the Insert AB will 
clone the selected rec. 

In both cases I assumed 
the Role of xxxx and my
Insert action had an
Impact of xxxx.

Lets modify some records
to see how the Update AB
works.
[Modify 2nd inserted
record and another 
unselected record].

This is a good time
to note that mod-ed fields
are marked Dirty with 
a small red marker in
the corner.  So when
we use the Update AB our
changes are commited,
and the Dirty field markers
go away.

So lets delete the two 
recs we just created ...

Now the Push AB is trivial
for the New grid because
this grid has not been
linked to other grids.

This concept of linked
grids and ABs can be
illustrated by moving
to the Find Pivot.

I wont illustrate
all the ABs for a Pivot 
here, as these can be
somewhat complex (I'll
cover these in a separate
help module).  But the 
Push AB is fairly straightfwd
to illustrate.
